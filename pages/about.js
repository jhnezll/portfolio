                <p className="text-3xl w-1/2 text-center">Iâ€™m John Ezell, a software engineer who focuses on making the most
                    elegant and powerful solution. For me, programming is much more than just the code! It's about
                    telling a client's story through an enjoyable and meaningful experience. I am able to adapt
                    and push my products to the next level. I specialize in web development and user interfaces.</p>
                <p className="text-xl w-1/2 text-center text-gray-500">Since I was born, I have always excelled at technology.
                    Being a software engineer and creating interesting programs and websites on the daily basis
                    is in the root of who I am. In my spare time, I enjoy playing League of Legends and weightlifting.
