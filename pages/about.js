                <p className="text-l md:text-3xl md:w-1/2 text-center">Iâ€™m John Ezell, a software engineer
                    who focuses on making the most elegant and powerful solutions. For me, programming is much more than
                    just the code! It's about telling a client's story through an enjoyable and meaningful experience.
                    I am constantly adapting and pushing my knowledge of computer science to the next level.
                    I specialize in web development and user interfaces.</p>
                <p className="text-sm md:text-xl md:w-1/2 text-center text-gray-500">
                    Since I was born, I have always excelled at the use of technology. Software engineering is all about creating
                    crafty, modern solutions, and that is rooted in who I am. In my spare time, I enjoy playing League
                    of Legends and weightlifting.
